### More Information

This blog is part of a Digital Humanities Capstone Project. I am looking at the ways in which electronic literature, interactive fiction, and other digital projects can be integrated into traditional library cataloging system - first by seeing how they are organized in born-digital collections, then by determining the best practices for describing them in an OPAC (with FRBR, RDA, and LOC standards - should be interesting!)
