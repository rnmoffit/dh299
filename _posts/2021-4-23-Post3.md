title: Content, Media, Carrier
---
This week, I've been thinking about how MARC records deal with non-book formats. It's important for a library catalog user to be able to see what kind of resource they're looking at before they actually search for it in the stacks: any given title could be for a book, an audiobook, a CD, a DVD, some microfiche, an atlas... (maybe not *any* given title...) Regardless, MARC records have three fields to describe an item's content, media, and carrier (fields 336, 337, and 338, respectively). Books are described as containing text ("336 $a text $2 rdacontent"), requiring no special equipment to use ("337 $a unmediated $2 rdamedia"), and having a book-like physical structure ("338 $a volume $2 rdacarrier"). Each field uses controlled vocabulary from an official RDA list, which is cited in the $2 subfield, making it possible to use other Thesauri to describe materials if there are better vocabulary choices. 

<!--The UCLA library catalog has an entry for the first two volumes of ELO’s e-literature collection, but doesn’t offer any information on the individual works. The Content is listed as “Text,” the media as “Computer” and the carrier as “Online Resource.” (Although there is also a CD-ROM version of the first volume, but it’s unclear what kind of computer it will play on.) Subjects are Literature – Periodicals and Arts – Periodicals; with Genre/Form headings as Digital Media, and Interactive multimedia. 
There are no title/author information for the works included in the collection.
	Clicking on Interactive multimedia leads to results of books and media. This entry doesn’t use the 336, 337, 338 fields, but mentions that it is a computer optical disc and lists the system requirements for viewing them in the notes section. (Since it’s a resource from 1997, I’m not sure how well it would play on modern systems.)
	Some of the earlier, groundbreaking works of e-literature are available to view through the purchase of USB drives, but might only work if you have a specific type of legacy system. (Some say you need a Macintosh computer with HyperCard.)
Is there a point to cataloging electronic literature if there’s no persistent identifier by which it can be accessed? These works seem like apt candidates for DOIs, which would be more secure than just listing a URL (not all websites are kept up to date.) The Interactive Fiction Database (ifdb.tads.org) lists both an IFID (Interactive Fiction Identifier – aiming to be the ISBN of a work – dependent on the author to create) for the website and a TUID (tads.org unique identifier – a  randomly generated 16 character string used for listings within the database). From the database entry, users can be taken to the work’s website, or directly download the work (as the case may be), as well as see different versions even source code.  -->
