title: Thousands of Tags
---
I can see why Controlled Vocabularies are so popular.

This week, I looked at the tags used within the Electronic Literature Knowledge Base ([ELMCIP](https://elmcip.net/)) in the hopes of getting a baseline understanding of how individual e-lit works are categorized within a digital collection. Visitors to ELMCIP can view tags by their frequency (in a list of 20 terms at a time), alphabetically (in an HTML table), or as part of a work's record (as comma-separated strings within a table of contents). To see the entire body of tags would require clicking through hundreds of pages, so I decided to put my meager web-scraping skills to the test (despite hating the term "web-scraping" - it sounds deeply unpleasant!).

### Cleaning
I made CSV spreadsheets of each version of the tag list (frequency, alphabetically, and record tags) - my goal was to have a list of tag names, tag ID numbers (which could be gleaned by the URL of each tag), and frequency of use. However, I noticed a lot of duplicate values showing up: tags that had the exact same name and ID number. At first, I thought it was something I was doing wrong (this was my first time web-scraping - hooray for internet tutorials!), or but after manually looking through the first ten pages of tags on the website, I saw that some tags were listed multiple times. I also noticed that the list of alphabetical tags didn't match up entirely with the frequency tags: my guess is that frequency tags have to have been used at least once to be listed, and so the extra tags on the alphabetical list were those that had not been used before. 

In any case, after several hours spent consolidating the alphabetical list with the frequency list and removing the duplications, I was able to narrow down the single list to tags from over 11,000 terms to over 8,000 terms.*


### Observations

Even before looking at the dataset, the most frequently used terms are those used to describe what the resource IS: hypertext, Flash, audio, image, 3D, etc. And that makes sense – people want to know what to expect when they click on something. The next most frequent is a broader description: poetry? literature? art? These broad descriptions start to jostle each other (what is the difference between digital literature and electronic literature?)
When these adjectives are thrown into combinations with broader terms or when “aboutness” is added, the tag list starts to get bloated. Further down the list, the majority of tags are only used once or twice to describe elements that are represented by metadata elsewhere – author, conference, title. 
Tags are a free-for-all – useful for knowing how things are described, but perhaps not the best official finding aid. 

Regardless, my list is not entirely accurate. Some tags could be consolidated, as they are misspellings, translations and variations of existing terms. This would also take longer).

^* It occurs to me that I could also turn the tags listed with the works records into a usable dataset, and determine the actual frequency with which each tag is used... but that would take much, much more time.^
